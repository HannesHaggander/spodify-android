# Spodify
Podcast focused Spotify android app

# Spotify already has a podcast tab, why are you doing this?
I like to have my application functionality separated. I want to use Spotify for music and music only and use another application entirely for podcasts.

# The project doesn't compile
Most likely becuase the project is missing the secret.xml file containing the following resources: spotify_client_id, spotify_secret_id, spodify_redirect_url, preference_file_key.
Feel free to make them with your own projects spotify's client and secret ids.
